Pype
====

Introduction
------------

Multi-platform open-source pipeline built around the [Avalon](https://getavalon.github.io/) platform,
expanding it with extra features and integrations. Pype connects asset database, project management
and time tracking into a single modular system. It has tight integration
with [ftrack](https://www.ftrack.com/en/), but it can also run independently.

To get all the key information about the project, go to [PYPE.club](http://pype.club)

Requirements
------------
Pype will run on most typical hardware configurations commonly found in studios around the world.
It is installed on artist computer and can take up 3Gb of space depending on number of versions
and other dependencies.

For well functioning [ftrack](https://www.ftrack.com/en/) event server, we recommend a
linux virtual server with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) or [CentosOS](https://www.centos.org/).
CPU and RAM allocation need differ based on the studio size, but a 2GB of RAM, with a
dual core CPU and around 4GB of storage should suffice.

Pype needs running [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) server with good connectivity as it is
heavily used by Pype. Depending on project size and number of artists working connection speed and
latency influence performance experienced by artists. If remote working is required, this mongodb
server must be accessible from Internet or cloud solution can be used. Reasonable backup plan
or high availability options are recommended.

Building Pype
-------------

To build Pype you currently need [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as we are following
[vfx platform](https://vfxplatform.com). Because of some Linux distros comes with newer Python version
already, you need to install **3.7** version and make use of it. You can use perhaps [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for this on Linux.

### Windows

You will need [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
More tools might be needed for installing dependencies (for example for **OpenTimelineIO**) - mostly
development tools like [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/cs/downloads/)

#### Clone repository:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:pypeclub/pype.git
```

#### To build Pype:

1) Run `.\tools\create_env.ps1` to create virtual environment in `.\venv`
2) Run `.\tools\build.ps1` to build pype executables in `.\build\`

To create distributable Pype versions, run `./tools/create_zip.ps1` - that will
create zip file with name `pype-vx.x.x.zip` parsed from current pype repository and
copy it to user data dir, or you can specify `--path /path/to/zip` to force it there.

You can then point **Igniter** - Pype setup tool - to directory containing this zip and
it will install it on current computer.

Pype is build using [CX_Freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest) to freeze itself and all dependencies.

### macOS

You will need [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You'll need also other tools to build
some Pype dependencies like [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and **XCode Command Line Tools** (or some other build system).

Easy way of installing everything necessary is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

1) Install **Homebrew**:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2) Install **cmake**:
```sh
brew install cmake
```

3) Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv):
```sh
brew install pyenv
echo 'eval "$(pypenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
pyenv init
exec "$SHELL"
PATH=$(pyenv root)/shims:$PATH
```

4) Pull in required Python version 3.7.x
```sh
# install Python build dependences
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib

# replace with up-to-date 3.7.x version
pyenv install 3.7.9
```

5) Set local Python version
```sh
# switch to Pype source directory
pyenv local 3.7.9
```

#### To build Pype:

1) Run `.\tools\create_env.sh` to create virtual environment in `.\venv`
2) Run `.\tools\build.sh` to build Pype executables in `.\build\`


### Linux

You will need [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You'll also need [curl](https://curl.se) on systems that doesn't have one preinstalled.

To build Python related stuff, you need Python header files installed (`python3-dev` on Ubuntu for example).

You'll need also other tools to build
some Pype dependencies like [CMake](https://cmake.org/). Python 3 should be part of all modern distributions. You can use your package manager to install **git** and **cmake**.

Install git, cmake and curl

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential checkinstall
sudo apt install git cmake curl
```
#### Note:
In case you run in error about `xcb` when running Pype,
you'll need also additional libraries for Qt5:

```sh
sudo apt install qt5-default
```

#### Note:
In case you run in error about `xcb` when running Pype,
you'll need also additional libraries for Qt5:

```sh
sudo yum install qt5-qtbase-devel
```

<summary>Use pyenv to install Python version for Pype build</summary>

You will need **bzip2**, **readline** and **sqlite3** libraries.

**Ubuntu:**
```sh
sudo apt install  libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev
```

1) install **pyenv**
```sh
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

# you can add those to ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

# reload shell
exec $SHELL

# install Python 3.7.9
pyenv install -v 3.7.9

# change path to pype 3
cd /path/to/pype-3

# set local python version
pyenv local 3.7.9

```

#### To build Pype:

1) Run `.\tools\create_env.sh` to create virtual environment in `.\venv`
2) Run `.\tools\build.sh` to build Pype executables in `.\build\`


Running Pype
------------

Pype can by executed either from live sources (this repository) or from
*"frozen code"* - executables that can be build using steps described above.

If Pype is executed from live sources, it will use Pype version included in them. If
it is executed from frozen code it will try to find latest Pype version installed locally
on current computer and if it is not found, it will ask for its location. On that location
pype can be either in directories or zip files. Pype will try to find latest version and
install it to user data directory (on Windows to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pypeclub\pype`, on Linux
`~/.local/share/pype` and on macOS in `~/Library/Application Support/pype`).

### From sources
Pype can be run directly from sources by activating virtual environment:

```sh
poetry run python start.py tray
```

This will use current Pype version with sources. You can override this with `--use-version=x.x.x` and
then Pype will try to find locally installed specified version (present in user data directory).

### From frozen code

You need to build Pype first. This will produce two executables - `pype_gui(.exe)` and `pype_console(.exe)`.
First one will act as GUI application and will not create console (useful in production environments).
The second one will create console and will write output there - useful for headless application and
debugging purposes. If you need pype version installed, just run `./tools/create_zip(.ps1|.sh)` without
arguments and it will create zip file that pype can use.


Building documentation
----------------------

Top build API documentation, run `.\tools\make_docs(.ps1|.sh)`. It will create html documentation
from current sources in `.\docs\build`.

**Note that it needs existing virtual environment.**

Running tests
-------------

To run tests, execute `.\tools\run_tests(.ps1|.sh)`.

**Note that it needs existing virtual environment.**
