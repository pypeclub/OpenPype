    """Validate name of Unreal Static Mesh

    Unreals naming convention states that staticMesh sould start with `SM`
    prefix - SM_[Name]_## (Eg. SM_sube_01). This plugin also validates other
    types of meshes - collision meshes:

    UBX_[RenderMeshName]_##:
                             Boxes are created with the Box objects type in
                             Max or with the Cube polygonal primitive in Maya.
                             You cannot move the vertices around or deform it
                             in any way to make it something other than a
                             rectangular prism, or else it will not work.

    UCP_[RenderMeshName]_##:
                             Capsules are created with the Capsule object type.
                             The capsule does not need to have many segments
                             (8 is a good number) at all because it is
                             converted into a true capsule for collision. Like
                             boxes, you should not move the individual
                             vertices around.

    USP_[RenderMeshName]_##:
                             Spheres are created with the Sphere object type.
                             The sphere does not need to have many segments
                             (8 is a good number) at all because it is
                             converted into a true sphere for collision. Like
                             boxes, you should not move the individual
                             vertices around.

    UCX_[RenderMeshName]_##:
                             Convex objects can be any completely closed
                             convex 3D shape. For example, a box can also be
                             a convex object

    This validator also checks if collision mesh [RenderMeshName] matches one
    of SM_[RenderMeshName].
